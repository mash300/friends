Choose one or more array methods to use while implementing each of the incomplete functions.
You MUST only use a combination of `MAP`, `FILTER`, and `REDUCE` array functions in order to accomplish your goal.
No use of `for` loops of any kind or the `forEach` function is permitted.

Remember, you can chain together array function calls to attain your goals. 
Ex: `array.filter().map()`

Follow the instructions contained in the accompanying `main.js` file.
